## 📧 Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses **FormSubmit.co** (free, no backend needed).

> **First-time setup:** After the first form submission, FormSubmit will send a confirmation email to `liftfitnesslk@gmail.com`. Click the link to activate. All future submissions will be delivered automatically.

⚠️ The form requires the site to be served via a web server (not `file://`).

> **Developer Note:** The form uses a hidden iframe (`target="hiddenFrame"`) to handle submissions. This bypasses strict CORS policies on static hosting (like GitHub Pages) that typically block direct AJAX requests to FormSubmit.co.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom Properties, Grid, Flexbox, Animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks)
- FormSubmit.co (Email delivery)
